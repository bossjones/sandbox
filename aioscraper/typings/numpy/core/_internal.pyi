    '''
    A decorator class for recursive nested functions.
    Naive recursive nested functions hold a reference to themselves:

    def outer(*args):
        def stringify_leaky(arg0, *arg1):
            if len(arg1) > 0:
                return stringify_leaky(*arg1)  # <- HERE
            return str(arg0)
        stringify_leaky(*args)

    This design pattern creates a reference cycle that is difficult for a
    garbage collector to resolve. The decorator class prevents the
    cycle by passing the nested function in as an argument `self`:

    def outer(*args):
        @recursive
        def stringify(self, arg0, *arg1):
            if len(arg1) > 0:
                return self(*arg1)
            return str(arg0)
        stringify(*args)
