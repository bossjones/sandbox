    Raises an AssertionError if two objects are not equal.

    Given two objects (scalars, lists, tuples, dictionaries or numpy arrays),
    check that all elements of these objects are equal. An exception is raised
    at the first conflicting values.

    When one of `actual` and `desired` is a scalar and the other is array_like,
    the function checks that each element of the array_like object is equal to
    the scalar.

    This function handles NaN comparisons as if NaN was a "normal" number.
    That is, AssertionError is not raised if both objects have NaNs in the same
    positions.  This is in contrast to the IEEE standard on NaNs, which says
    that NaN compared to anything must return False.

    Parameters
    ----------
    actual : array_like
        The object to check.
    desired : array_like
        The expected object.
    err_msg : str, optional

    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, the conflicting values are appended to the error message.

    Notes
    -----
    When one of `x` and `y` is a scalar and the other is array_like, the

     y: array([1.      , 3.141593,      nan])

    Use `assert_allclose` or one of the nulp (number of floating point values)
    functions for these cases instead:

    ...                            rtol=1e-10, atol=0)

    As mentioned in the Notes section, `assert_array_equal` has special
    handling for scalars. Here the test checks that each value in `x` is 3:

    >>> x = np.full((2, 5), fill_value=3)
    >>> np.testing.assert_array_equal(x, 3)

    """
    ...

def assert_array_almost_equal(x, y, decimal=..., err_msg=..., verbose=...): # -> None:

    The test verifies identical shapes and that the elements of ``actual`` and

class clear_and_catch_warnings(warnings.catch_warnings):

    Warnings can be slippery, because, whenever a warning is triggered, Python
    adds a ``__warningregistry__`` member to the *calling* module.  This makes
    it impossible to retrigger the warning in this module, whatever you put in
    the warnings filters.  This context manager accepts a sequence of `modules`
    as a keyword argument to its constructor and:

    * stores and removes any ``__warningregistry__`` entries in given `modules`
      on entry;
    * resets ``__warningregistry__`` to its previous state on exit.

    This makes it possible to trigger any warning afresh inside the context
    manager without disturbing the state of warnings outside.

    For compatibility with Python 3.0, please consider all arguments to be
    keyword-only.

    Parameters
    ----------
    record : bool, optional
        Specifies whether warnings should be captured by a custom
        implementation of ``warnings.showwarning()`` and be appended to a list
        returned by the context manager. Otherwise None is returned by the
        context manager. The objects appended to the list are arguments whose
        attributes mirror the arguments to ``showwarning()``.
    modules : sequence, optional
        Sequence of modules for which to reset warnings registry on entry and
        restore on exit. To work correctly, all 'ignore' filters should
        filter by one of these modules.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import warnings
    >>> with np.testing.clear_and_catch_warnings(
    ...         modules=[np.core.fromnumeric]):
    ...     warnings.simplefilter('always')

class suppress_warnings:
    """
    Context manager and decorator doing much the same as
    ``warnings.catch_warnings``.

    However, it also provides a filter mechanism to work around
    https://bugs.python.org/issue4180.

    This bug causes Python before 3.4 to not reliably show warnings again
    after they have been ignored once (even within catch_warnings). It
    means that no "ignore" filter can be used easily, since following
    tests might need to see the warning. Additionally it allows easier
    specificity for testing warnings and can be nested.

    Parameters
    ----------
    forwarding_rule : str, optional
        One of "always", "once", "module", or "location". Analogous to
        the usual warnings module filter mode, it is useful to reduce
        noise mostly on the outmost level. Unsuppressed and unrecorded
        warnings will be forwarded based on this rule. Defaults to "always".
        "location" is equivalent to the warnings "default", match by exact
        location the warning warning originated from.

    Notes
    -----
    Filters added inside the context manager will be discarded again
    when leaving it. Upon entering all filters defined outside a
    context will be applied automatically.

    When a recording filter is added, matching warnings are stored in the
    ``log`` attribute as well as in the list returned by ``record``.

    If filters are added and the ``module`` keyword is given, the
    warning registry of this module will additionally be cleared when
    applying it, entering the context, or exiting it. This could cause
    warnings to appear a second time after leaving the context if they
    were configured to be printed once (default) and were already
    printed before the context was entered.

    Nesting this context manager will work as expected when the
    forwarding rule is "always" (default). Unfiltered and unrecorded
    warnings will be passed out and be matched by the outer level.
    On the outmost level they will be printed (or caught by another
    warnings context). The forwarding rule argument can modify this
    behaviour.

    Like ``catch_warnings`` this context manager is not threadsafe.

    Examples
    --------

    With a context manager::

        with np.testing.suppress_warnings() as sup:
            sup.filter(DeprecationWarning, "Some text")
