# python resize.py --image ../images/trex.png

import argparse

# from cv2 import cv2
import cv2
import imutils
# Import the necessary packages

# Construct the argument parser and parse the arguments
ap = argparse.ArgumentParser()
ap.add_argument("-i", "--image", required=True, help="Path to the image")

# Load the image and show it
image = cv2.imread(args["image"])
cv2.imshow("Original", image)

# We need to keep in mind aspect ratio so the image does
# not look skewed or distorted -- therefore, we calculate
# the ratio of the new image to the old image. Let's make
# our new image have a width of 150 pixels
# r = aspect ratio
# dim = dimensions
r = 150.0 / image.shape[1]
dim = (150, int(image.shape[0] * r))

# Perform the actual resizing of the image
resized = cv2.resize(image, dim, interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
cv2.imshow("Resized (Width)", resized)

# What if we wanted to adjust the height of the image? We
# apply the same concept, again keeping in mind the aspect
# ratio, but instead calculating the ratio based on height.
# Let's make the height of the resized image 50 pixels
r = 50.0 / image.shape[0]
dim = (int(image.shape[1] * r), 50)

# Perform the resizing
resized = cv2.resize(image, dim, interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)

# Of course, calculating the ratio each and every time we
# want to resize an image is a real pain. Let's create a
# function where we can specify our target width or height,
# and have it take care of the rest for us.
resized = imutils.resize(image, width=100)
