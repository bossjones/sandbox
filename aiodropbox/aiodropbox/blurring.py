# Let's apply standard "averaging" blurring first. Average
# blurring (as the name suggests), takes the average of all
# pixels in the surrounding area and replaces the centeral
# element of the output image with the average. Thus, in
# order to have a central element, the area surrounding the
# central must be odd. Here are a few examples with varying
# kernel sizes. Notice how the larger the kernel gets, the
# more blurred the image becomes

# We can also apply Gaussian blurring, where the relevant
# parameters are the image we want to blur and the standard
# deviation in the X and Y direction. Again, as the standard
# deviation size increases, the image becomes progressively
# more blurred
blurred = np.hstack(

        cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (3, 3), 0),

# The cv2.medianBlur function is mainly used for removing
# what is called "salt-and-pepper" noise. Unlike the Average
# method mentioned above, the median method (as the name
# suggests), calculates the median pixel value amongst the
# surrounding area.
blurred = np.hstack(
    [cv2.medianBlur(image, 3), cv2.medianBlur(image, 5), cv2.medianBlur(image, 7)]

# You may have noticed that blurring can help remove noise,
# but also makes edge less sharp. In order to keep edges
# sharp, we can use bilateral filtering. We need to specify
# the diameter of the neighborhood (as in examples above),
# along with sigma values for color and coordinate space.
# The larger these sigma values, the more pixels will be
# considered within the neighborhood.
