# As the Python team, we are helping to ensure that packages have high-quality type annotations. In cases where this must be done through type stubs, we are contributing stubs to typeshed. This repository contains our "work in progress". Once the stubs for a package meet the requirements of typeshed, we will contribute them to typeshed and delete them from this repository.
