Chebyshev Series (:mod:`numpy.polynomial.chebyshev`)
====================================================

This module provides a number of objects (mostly functions) useful for
dealing with Chebyshev series, including a `Chebyshev` class that
encapsulates the usual arithmetic operations.  (General information
on how this module represents and works with such polynomials is in the
docstring for its "parent" sub-package, `numpy.polynomial`).

Notes
-----
The implementations of multiplication, division, integration, and
differentiation use the algebraic identities [1]_:

.. math ::
    T_n(x) = \\frac{z^n + z^{-n}}{2} \\\\
    z\\frac{dx}{dz} = \\frac{z - z^{-1}}{2}.

where

.. math :: x = \\frac{z + z^{-1}}{2}.

These identities allow a Chebyshev series to be expressed as a finite,
symmetric Laurent series.  In this module, this sort of Laurent series
is referred to as a "z-series."

def chebfromroots(roots):

    The function returns the coefficients of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = (x - r_0) * (x - r_1) * ... * (x - r_n),

    in Chebyshev form, where the `r_n` are the roots specified in `roots`.
    If a zero has multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times.
    For instance, if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of
    multiplicity 2, then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The
    roots can appear in any order.

    If the returned coefficients are `c`, then

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * T_1(x) + ... +  c_n * T_n(x)

    The coefficient of the last term is not generally 1 for monic

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.
    Why is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
    variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`.  Then
    :math:`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
    :math:`1/a`- perhaps not what one would have first thought.

    Also note that, in general, the result of integrating a C-series needs
    to be "reprojected" onto the C-series basis set.  Thus, typically,
    the result of this function is "unintuitive," albeit correct; see

        If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones
        on the right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0
        for this action. The result is that every column of coefficients in
        `c` is evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast
        over the columns of `c` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful
        when `c` is multidimensional. The default value is True.

    The solution is the coefficients of the Chebyshev series `p` that

    .. math:: E = \\sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,

    where :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by setting up
    as the (typically) overdetermined matrix equation

    .. math:: V(x) * c = w * y,

    where `V` is the weighted pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, `c` are the
    coefficients to be solved for, `w` are the weights, and `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of `V`.

    If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
    neglected, then a `RankWarning` will be issued. This means that the
    coefficient values may be poorly determined. Using a lower order fit
    will usually get rid of the warning.  The `rcond` parameter can also be
    set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting fit may be
    spurious and have large contributions from roundoff error.

    Fits using Chebyshev series are usually better conditioned than fits
    using power series, but much can depend on the distribution of the
    sample points and the smoothness of the data. If the quality of the fit
    is inadequate splines may be a good alternative.

    The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion

    The Chebyshev polynomials used in the interpolation are orthogonal when
    sampled at the Chebyshev points of the first kind. If it is desired to
    constrain some of the coefficients they can simply be set to the desired
    value after the interpolation, no new interpolation or fit is needed. This
    is especially useful if it is known apriori that some of coefficients are
    zero. For instance, if the function is even then the coefficients of the
    terms of odd degree in the result can be set to zero.

    Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.

    Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.
    These sample points and weights will correctly integrate polynomials of
    degree :math:`2*deg - 1` or less over the interval :math:`[-1, 1]` with
    the weight function :math:`f(x) = 1/\\sqrt{1 - x^2}`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    deg : int
        Number of sample points and weights. It must be >= 1.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the sample points.
    y : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the weights.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    The results have only been tested up to degree 100, higher degrees may
    be problematic. For Gauss-Chebyshev there are closed form solutions for
    the sample points and weights. If n = `deg`, then

    .. math:: x_i = \\cos(\\pi (2 i - 1) / (2 n))

    .. math:: w_i = \\pi / n
