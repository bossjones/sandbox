Due to compatibility, numpy has a very large number of different naming
conventions for the scalar types (those subclassing from `numpy.generic`).
This file produces a convoluted set of dictionaries mapping names to types,
and sometimes other mappings too.

.. data:: allTypes
    A dictionary of names to types that will be exposed as attributes through
    ``np.core.numerictypes.*``

.. data:: sctypeDict
    Similar to `allTypes`, but maps a broader set of aliases to their types.

.. data:: sctypeNA
    NumArray-compatible names for the scalar types. Contains not only
    ``name: type`` mappings, but ``char: name`` mappings too.

    .. deprecated:: 1.16

.. data:: sctypes
    A dictionary keyed by a "type group" string, providing a list of types
    under that group.
